# What is a feature gate?
A feature gate is a mechanism for teams to configure what system behavior is visible to users without changing application code. Feature gates are also commonly called feature flags or feature toggles. 

## When to use feature gates
Feature gates are commonly used as on/off switches to turn a certain system behavior on or off in production. Teams often use feature gates to turn on certain features or behavior for a small percentage of the total user base. Teams may do this to gradually ramp up a software release across their user base to limit the impact of any unanticipated system behavior, or to enable a restricted behavior only for a specific set of users.
